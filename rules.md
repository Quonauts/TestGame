## Meta rules

This section details how the rules are to be applied to the game.

<a name='precedence'/>

### Precedence

In the case of a contradiction between clauses, the following criteria are to be considered in turn until a clear determination can be made as to which clause takes precedence:

If one clause has a more limited scope than another, then the clause with the more limited scope takes precedence.
If one clause is negative while the other is positive, then the negative clause takes precedence.
The clause which appears last in the rules takes precedence.

<a name='disallow-by-default'/>

### Disallowed by default

Unless explicitly stated in the rules, all game actions are forbidden.

<a name='rule-violations'/>

### Rule violations

A rule violation is a game action that is not permitted by the rules.

<a name='errors'/>

#### Errors

An error is a rule violation made by a player either mistakenly or through ignorance. If this player is able to alter the game state so that it is as it would be if the error had never occurred, they may do so.
