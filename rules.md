## <a name='meta'/> Meta rules

This section details how the rules are to be applied to the game.

### <a name='precedence'/> Precedence

In the case of a contradiction between clauses, the following criteria are to be considered in turn until a clear determination can be made as to which clause takes precedence:

If one clause has a more limited scope than another, then the clause with the more limited scope takes precedence.
If one clause is negative while the other is positive, then the negative clause takes precedence.
The clause which appears last in the rules takes precedence.

### <a name='disallow-by-default'/> Disallowed by default

Unless explicitly stated in the rules, all game actions are forbidden.

### <a name='rule-violations'/> Rule violations

A rule violation is a game action that is not permitted by the rules.

#### <a name='errors'/> Errors

An error is a rule violation made by a player either mistakenly or through ignorance. If this player is able to alter the game state so that it is as it would be if the error had never occurred, they may do so.

#### <a name='rule-violation-polls'/> Rule violation polls

If any player (hereby "the accusing player") believes that another player (hereby "the accused player") has violated the rules, then the accusing player may conduct a majority poll (called a "rule violation poll") to determine whether the accused player has violated the rules.

In conducting a rule violation poll, the accusing player must describe which sections or clauses of the rules were violated and what illegal game action was taken by the accused player. Players should vote in favor of this poll if, and only if, they agree that the accused player violated the rules as described.

Any vote in such a poll cast by the accused player is not counted.

A rule violation poll must be available for voting for at least 24 hours before any action may be taken as a result.

For any potential rule violation, only one rule violation poll may be conducted.

A rule violation poll may not be started more than 7 days after the potential rule violation.

If a rule violation poll passes, then the accused player is now convicted of violating the rules as described in the poll. The effects of the rule violation must be reversed to the extent it is possible to do so as quickly as possible.

#### <a name='punitive-action'/> Punitive action

If a player (hereby "the convicted player") is convicted, then another player may conduct a majority poll (called a "puninitive action poll") to determine whether punitive action should be taken.

Players should vote in favour of this poll if, and only if, they believe the convicted player violated the rules knowingly and with malicious intent.

Any vote in such a poll cast by the convicted player is not counted.

If a punitive action poll passes, then the convicted player gains one strike.
